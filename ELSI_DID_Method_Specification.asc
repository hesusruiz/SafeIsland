This is the abstract.

== ELSI DID Scheme

The name ELSI stands for (**E**)TSI (**L**)egal person (**S**)emantics (**I**)dentifier, and corresponds to the information that should be included in the _organizationIdentifier_ attribute as described in the European Norm ETSI EN 319 412-1, related to digital signatures, peer entity authentication, data authentication as well as data confidentiality.

The structure of the DID (after the initial "did:elsi:" prefix) is:

- 3 character legal person identity type reference;
- 2 character ISO 3166 [2] country code;
- hyphen-minus "-" (0x2D (ASCII), U+002D (UTF-8)); and
- identifier (according to country and identity type reference).

For the three initial characters we support the following options:

- "VAT" for identification based on a national value added tax identification number.
- "LEI" for the https://www.gleif.org[Legal Entity Identifier]

Some examples of DIDs are the following:

== ELSI DID Document specification

=== A simple DID document

A simple DID document has the following structure:

```javascript
{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/v1"
    ],
    "id": "did:elsi:VATES-A87471264",
    "publicKey": [{ ... }],
    "authentication": [{ ... }],
    "service": [{ ... }]
}
```



```javascript
{
   "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "https://w3id.org/security/v1"
   ],
   "id": "did:elsi:VATES-A87471264",
   "publicKey": [
      {
         "id": "did:elsi:VATES-A87471264#key-verification",
         "type": "JwsVerificationKey2020",
         "controller": "did:elsi:VATES-A87471264",
         "publicKeyJwk": {
            "kid": "key-verification",
            "kty": "EC",
            "crv": "secp256k1",
            "x": "ZL_ptqpDVKnQhPDkYkknil0UhbHyCxIZ1BhLu-JGVdY",
            "y": "t6BHQ8_YMpezU65o_OyIdFK-tp52FbGyg_MPlGgSBPs"
         }
      }
   ],
   "service": [
      {
         "id": "did:elsi:VATES-A87471264#info",
         "type": "EntityCommercialInfo",
         "serviceEndpoint": "metrovacesa.com",
         "name": "Metrovacesa"
      }
   ],
   "alaExtension": {
      "redT": {
         "domain": "metrovacesa.ala",
         "ethereumAddress": "0x674c0726D02519aA0cbC40de011BB3497dBCad49"
      }
   },
   "created": "2020-12-15T20:04:58Z",
   "updated": "2020-12-15T20:04:58Z"
}
```


For the moment, in Alastria we will not use the "**authentication**" and “**service**” sections.

### 2.2.2. DID Document Context

As per the  [DID specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/), Alastria will use the context defined here: [https://w3id.org/did/v1](https://w3id.org/did/v1):

```javascript
"@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1"
```

### 2.2.3. Public keys

The keys associated to the Alastria.ID in the Quorum implementation have to be generated according to the Ethereum specifications. In the current version of the DID specification "[Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v0.11](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/)" such keys are not yet supported, so we have to define a new key type.

The suggested name is "**_EcdsaKoblitzPublicKey_**" given that Bitcoin and Ethereum use the Koblitz Elliptic Curve, also known as *secp256k1*. This is also consistent with the upcoming definition of a new Signature Suite in the Verifiable Credentials Data Model, called “**_EcdsaKoblitzSignature2016_**”.

An example publicKey entry in the DID Document, with a single key, could be:

```javascript
...
"publicKey": [{
    "id": "did:ala:quor:testnet1:3eabc53a851fc5039eae2146083cdc42a87aeeacf848efb9924a381cc4b2b5d1#keys-1",
    "type": ["CryptographicKey", "EcdsaKoblitzPublicKey"],
    "curve": "secp256k1",
    "expires": "2019-06-11T22:07:10Z",
    "publicKeyHex": "0xf42987b7faee8b95e2c3a3345224f00e00dfc67ba88266b35efd6fc481e162b7f3471617b2433cdc74d04c81ef6db911ca416efa296cd2c4962e35d804560104"
}],
...
```

The "id" of the “publicKey” has two components:

1. "**did:ala:quor:testnet1:3eabc53a851fc5039eae2146083cdc42a87aeeacf848efb9924a381cc4b2b5d1**" is the DID for the owner of the key, which is the DID subject.

2. "**#keys-1**" is a URI fragment which specifies the specific key from the DID subject. For the moment, an Alastria.ID has only one key, but this is the generic mechanism in the DID specification to identify several keys for several purposes. In order to achieve forward compatibility, it is recommended to use a URI fragment to identify the key, even though currently is not strictly necessary.
